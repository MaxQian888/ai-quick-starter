## Extracted Content

Encryption Post ​ 

Firefly supports password protection for posts. Encrypted posts are encrypted at build time using the AES-256-GCM algorithm — no plaintext content exists in the page source. Visitors must enter the correct password, and the browser decrypts the content locally via the Web Crypto API. 

Basic Usage ​ 

Add the 
password 
field to the Front-matter to enable encryption: 

yaml 

--- title : Private Post published : 2025-01-01 password : "your-password" --- All content here will be encrypted. 

Password Hint ​ 

Optionally add a 
passwordHint 
field to give visitors a hint: 

yaml 

--- title : Private Post published : 2025-01-01 password : "your-password" passwordHint : "My birthday" ---

Session Cache ​ 

After entering the correct password, it is cached in the browser's 
sessionStorage 

Refreshing the page within the same session does not require re-entering the password 

Cache is cleared when the browser is closed 

Technical Details ​ 

Encryption : AES-256-GCM 

Key Derivation : PBKDF2 (SHA-256, 100,000 iterations) 

Build-time encryption : Node.js 
crypto 
module 

Client-side decryption : Native Web Crypto API, no third-party dependencies 

Supports both 
.md 
and 
.mdx 
formats 

TIP 

The password is written in plaintext in the Front-matter and is only used at build time. The build output does not contain the original password — only the encrypted ciphertext. 

WARNING 

Encryption security depends on password strength. Since the ciphertext is publicly visible in the page source, weak passwords can theoretically be brute-forced. Use a sufficiently complex password.
